=======================

Currently we have two courses available here.

The Bioconductor course (2014) was created and presented by Thomas Carroll at the Boston BioC2104 meeting [http://www.bioconductor.org/help/course-materials/2014/BioC2014/Bioc2014_ChIPQC_Practical.pdf](http://www.bioconductor.org/help/course-materials/2014/BioC2014/Bioc2014_ChIPQC_Practical.pdf). This course covers matters of ChIP-seq quality control.

The Cambridge Genetics course was created and presented by Thomas Carroll at Cambridge genetics for **the Bioinformatics: Analysis of High-throughput sequencing data with Bioconductor** [http://training.csx.cam.ac.uk/event/678728](http://training.csx.cam.ac.uk/event/678728). This course covers ChIP-seq quality control, visualisation and downstream analysis.
