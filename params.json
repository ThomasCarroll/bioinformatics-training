{"name":"Bioinformatics-training","tagline":"","body":"bioinformatics-training\r\n=======================\r\nCurrent material\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nCurrently we have two courses available here.\r\n\r\n>The Bioconductor course (2014) was created and presented by Thomas Carroll at the Boston BioC2104 meeting [http://www.bioconductor.org/help/course-materials/2014/BioC2014/Bioc2014_ChIPQC_Practical.pdf](http://www.bioconductor.org/help/course-materials/2014/BioC2014/Bioc2014_ChIPQC_Practical.pdf). This course covers matters of ChIP-seq quality control.\r\n\r\n*Material for this course can be found at the [Bioconductor site](http://www.bioconductor.org/help/course-materials/2014/BioC2014/Bioc2014_ChIPQC_Practical.pdf) or with all the required data here [BioC2014](https://github.com/ThomasCarroll/bioinformatics-training/tree/master/ChIPseq/ChIP_Quality_Control/bioc_2014)*\r\n\r\n>The Cambridge Genetics course was created and presented by Thomas Carroll and Shamith Samarajiwa at Cambridge genetics for **the Bioinformatics: Analysis of High-throughput sequencing data with Bioconductor** [http://training.csx.cam.ac.uk/event/678728](http://training.csx.cam.ac.uk/event/678728). This course covers ChIP-seq quality control, visualisation and downstream analysis.\r\n\r\n*Material for this course can be found here [Cambridge Genetics ChIP-seq Material](https://github.com/ThomasCarroll/bioinformatics-training/tree/master/ChIPseq/ChIP_Quality_Control/Genetics_Cambridge)*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpcoming Courses\r\n-----------------\r\nIntroduction to R ([Day 1](https://cdn.rawgit.com/ThomasCarroll/htqc/master/r_course/introToR_Day1.html#/)/[Day 2](https://cdn.rawgit.com/ThomasCarroll/htqc/master/r_course/introToR_Day2.html#/))\r\n\r\nVisualisation of Genomics Data in IGV.\r\n\r\nBeginners guide to ChIP-seq analysis in R.\r\n\r\nBeginners guide to RNA-seq analysis in R.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you would like to ask a question about these courses or suggest a training topic please contact us on [thomas.carroll@csc.mrc.ac.uk](thomas.carroll@csc.mrc.ac.uk).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
